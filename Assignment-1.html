      <b><span class="inner1">HyperText Markup Language</span></b> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as CSS and JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. It describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.

      <b><span class="inner2">Cascading Style Sheets</span></b> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. It is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content.

      <b><span class="inner3">JavaScript</span></b> is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. It is designed for creating network-centric applications. It is complimentary to and integrated with Java. JavaScript is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform. Javascript is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. JavaScript was initially created to make web pages alive.The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads. Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.
